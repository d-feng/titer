# Translation Initiation siTE detectoR (TITER)
This is an instruction of predicting translation initiation sites using TITER.

Guidance:

1. Install scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) and keras (https://keras.io/) first.

2. Edit file paths (e.g., the homepath) in the scripts based on your settings.

3. Unzip data.zip, then put the test data in the data/ folder if you want to predict your own data. Otherwise, directly run codes/tide_test.py to reproduce the results in our paper. Note that all the input sequence data are formatted in Python.

4. The trained models are in the model/ folder.

5. Note that the codes and data released here are only for the demo use, and a user-friendly version of our TIDE software is coming soon.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me :)
