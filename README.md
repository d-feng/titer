# Translation Initiation siTE detectoR (TITER)
This is an instruction of predicting translation initiation sites (TISs) using TITER.

Guidance:

1. Install scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) and keras (https://keras.io/) first.

2. Edit file paths (e.g., the HOMEPATH) in the scripts based on your settings.

3. Unzip data.zip, then put the test data in the data/ folder if you want to predict your own data. Otherwise, directly run codes/titer_test.py to reproduce the results in our paper. Note that all the input data should be formatted in Python's array structure.
